# Beginning iOS

![Platform iOS](https://img.shields.io/badge/nanodegree-iOS-blue.svg)

This repository contains resources for Beginning iOS and Udacity's Learning Swift course.

## Overview

Beginning iOS covers a broad range of topics mainly in the form of Xcode playgrounds. The playgrounds are grouped by their related project and include examples and problems for you to try.

## Setup

Most projects and playgrounds contained in this repository should run without any additional setup. There are a few playgrounds, however, where small fixes must be made before they will successfully run. In those cases, consult the classroom or comments left in the code to resolve.
