//: ## Enum syntax

//: To define an enumeration we start with the word _enum_, followed by a name for the group of values, and then a series of cases between curly braces:
enum Season {
    case fall
    case winter
    case spring
    case summer
}

//: The cases can also be listed separated by commas, as in this enum of Gabrielle's aunties:
enum Aunties {
    case aime, billie, diane, gail, janie, pam
}

//: [Next](@next)
